Largely identical to the original version, but modified to allow throttle control via RC remote (PWM).
Key differences:
  - Motors turn of when throttle is centered
  - Soft braking
  - RC Remote input

This is intended to be used with a custom electric longboard, and as such does not need steering.



Currently Work-In-Progress

The code is used in a 2wd all-terrain board, based on a standard longboard:

With the current settings allowing 15A to each motor @ 40V, this results in close to 1200W of power (and > 20kmh) - which is plenty for an inexperinced rider.

The hoverboard wheels are of the standard 6.5" variety. Holes have been drilled in the front of the rotor, allowing a set of 10" pneumatic wheels to be attached with bolts.


Battery: 13Ah (30A Max discharge) E-bike battery

Control: 2.4GHz 2ch radio controller ([Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/2-4Ghz-Mini-remote-Controller-With-Receiver-For-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard/202629525712?hash=item2f2da930d0:g:3wEAAOSwHN9ckLCL&frcectupt=true))

Wheels: 10" pneumatic wheels for gardening equipment

The attachment of the wheels is somewhat dodgy, since I do not have access to welding equipment. It does work though, since there is a channel in the original trucks where the pipe can rest securely. The wheels fit inside the pipe, and are secured with a set screw.
